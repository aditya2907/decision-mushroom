# Can we eat this mushroom?

This project is based on a dataset on mushrooms consisting of physical
attributes such as cap shape and odor and each mushroom in the
sample is classified as either edible or poisonous. The goal here is to 
train decision trees to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous
based on its physical attributes.
